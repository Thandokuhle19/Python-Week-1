~Variable and Types:~
Variable -Basic unit of a program, assigned a value. 
Equal sign (=) is used as an assignment operator.
Variable names include upper and lower cases, including underscores, and usually begin with lowercases. It cannot begin with a number
There are several types of variable in python and they are: - Integers >> whole numbers (floats: decimal numbers), complex numbers(used                                                               for complex mathematical calculations), 
                                                            - Strings (collections of characters),
                                                            - Booleans (true or false values)
The plus sign (+) is used to join characters, when working in strings, but it does not add strings or numbers. 

~Data Structures:~
Data Structures - allow for storage of a list of values in a single 
One of the first data structure we will learn is a list. They contain a data type, which includes a list within a list.
Length of a list is determined by using length function [which is len()]. Eg, myList = ["apple","banana","cherry"] 
                                                                              x = len(myList) >> this will print out what is inside the list, in order.
Set is similar to a lit, but differs in such that it contains unique elements and is declared by the use of curly braces. Eg, thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
print(thisset) >> this will print out whatever is inside the "thisset", in no particular order

In a list, the order of your elements is important, unlike a set.
Tuples cannot but modified once they have been declared. This means that they are unchangeable, we cannot add or remove items after the tuple has been created. 
Tuples use round brackets. Eg, thistuple = ("apple","banana","cherry") 
                           print(thistuple)

 ~Operators:~
Operators: instructions that perform operations on variable and values. Familiar type operator is the arithmetic, used for mathematical calculations.
Example of arithmetic operator are addition(+) for adding numbers together, multiplication(*) for mulitplying numbers together, exponents(**) raises a number to a specified power, division(/) returns a floating
